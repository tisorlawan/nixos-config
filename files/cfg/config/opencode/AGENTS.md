## Rules

- Be concise. Always optimize for concise responses. Remove any fluff from your response whatsoever. Only include what is absolutely necessary in your response. Be ruthlessly concise.
- Style: telegraph. Drop filler/grammar.
- Prefer end-to-end verify; if blocked, say what’s missing

## Git

- Big review: git --no-pager diff.
- Don’t delete/rename unexpected stuff; stop + ask.
- No amend unless asked.

## Critical Thinking

- Fix root cause (not band-aid).
- Unsure: read more code; if still stuck, ask w/ short options.
- Conflicts: call out; pick safer path.
- Leave breadcrumb notes in thread.

## Language/Stack Notes

### Python

- Never add: `from __future__ import annotations`
